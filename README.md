# PyLyrics

Downloads and plays lyrics of the currently playing song, synced with elapsed time.

Uses the currently playing song by quering mpd, download the lyrics and syncs with the currently playing song.

Copy lyrics.py to a directory, run by either `python2 pylyrics.py` or mark executable and run `./pylyrics.py` or by `pylyrics.py` after adding to path.

Works on most English songs. Tried and tested with mpsyt. If lyrics are out of sync (lagging or running, try a different youtube song verson.)
